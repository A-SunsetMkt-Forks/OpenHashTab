# OpenHashTab

## About

OpenHashTab is a shell extension for conveniently calculating and checking file hashes from file properties.

## Features

* Support for 14 different selectable algorithms, see **Algorithms**
* md5sum / sha1sum / sha256sum / etc.. compatibility for checking and exporting hashes
* Easy to use checker and single-click sumfile export to clipboard or file
* Select then 
* High performance hash calculation
* Native Windows looks
* Long path support\*
* Multilingual: English, German, Italian, Hungarian, Simplified Chinese, Spanish, Danish, Russian

\* On Windows 8 or later, to the extent Windows supports it.

## System requirements

* Windows Vista or later (x86 / x64 / ARM64)
* 1 GB RAM or more (for efficent hashing of more than 512 files at a time)

## Usage

Most of the actions should be obvious. Some not-so-obvious features are listed here:

* You can select multiple files or folders, all files will be hashed.
* Double click hash to copy it
* Double click name or algorithm to copy the line in sumfile format
* Select one or more lines then right click to copy all columns of the lines, separated by tabs
* Double right click to copy everything, separated by tabs
* The counters next to the status text is in the format `(match/mismatch/nothing to check against/error)`
* Selecting the tab on a sumfile will interpret it as such and hash the files listed in it.
* If a hashed file has a sumfile with same filename plus one of the [recognized sumfile extensions](https://github.com/namazso/OpenHashTab/blob/master/OpenHashTab/Hasher.cpp#L242-L251), the file hash is checked against it.

## Algorithms

* CRC32
* MD2, MD4, MD5
* RipeMD160
* Blake2sp
* SHA-1
* SHA-2 (SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, SHA-512)
* SHA-3 (SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512)
* BLAKE3

## Relationship to HashTab

HashTab is a similar purpose proprietary software. While this software has been inspired by it, I was never an user of HashTab and this software contains no code or anything related to it.
